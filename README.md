Padding techniques, phase estimation, amplitude amplification, and entanglement were used to improve feature extraction and classification accuracy. Two cyclic symmetric types of padding are used, one for the quantum convolution (QuC) operation to retain spatial consistency and increase output dimensioning. For phase estimation of unitary operators, quantum phase estimation (QPE) has been integrated along with amplitude amplification and entanglement-based techniques for boosting performance. This was done on both MNIST and FashionMNIST, where all models ran simultaneously with different stride and padding configurations accompanied by quantum enhancements. Results show that QuC neural networks (QCNNs) models that incorporate cyclic padding outperform symmetric padding for every configuration, while operations assisted by entanglement still achieved the highest accuracy: 98.1%. Thus, this research brings crucial insights into how quantum techniques might improve the application of QCNN with utmost precision and efficiency in complex image processing tasks.
